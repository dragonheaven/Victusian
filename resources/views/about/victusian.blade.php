								<blockquote>Our common purpose is to bring people together in a creative and fun way, which helps them to grow from within and thereby achieve the best of their personal possibilities. It is to re connect society and revive connections from within.</blockquote>

								<p>We are comprised of go doers, serial entrepreneurs, the charitable, the awakened joe's and jill's, mystics, 
								clairvoyant intuitives, financial guru's and others who make up our inner circle called legion. Much like a board
								 of supervisors they make sure we keep the quality measures high and most of all provide a holis(c training for the
								  individuals to thrive in their unique life purpose.</p>
								<p>We understand that any kind of change and growth first and foremost comes from within. Therefore anyone starting								
								 is working on themselves within a community vibe that embraces the fun in doing it together. The Masters are not 
								 employees of Victus but independent teachers, trainers, coaches, healers and experts in their respective field with 
								 their own offline set up. They are carefully monitored, rated and reviewed by our community.</p>
								<h4>Our core mission is to bring happiness and show our members their path and key to their personal happiness.</h4>
								<p>We join together to grow together, just like a flower flourishes in nature within a healthy ecosystem.</p>
